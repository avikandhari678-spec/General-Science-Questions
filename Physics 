Q.-What if Earth acceleration due to gravity is const above and below the earth surface?
-Above Earth: Objects would keep feeling the same pull no matter how far they go.  A rocket could never fully escape Earth’s gravity because gravity would never weaken.
Inside the Earth: Instead of reducing as you go deeper, the pull would still be the same. That means at the very centre of Earth, you’d still feel a strong downward force, instead of floating weightless.

Q:Why moving charges produce both electric field and magnetic field but a current carrying conductor produces only magnetic field 
- Since a charge has a characteristic of producing an electric field of its own and since its moving as well so it produces magnetic field as in according to Biot Savart's Law. But a current carrying wire although contains charges produces electric field is cancelled by the opposite charges present in the wire. So electric field by a charge is neutralized by the opposite charge. Magnetic is produced as usual by electrons due to their locomotion
