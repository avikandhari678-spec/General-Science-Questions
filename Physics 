Q.-What if Earth acceleration due to gravity is const above and below the earth surface?
-Above Earth: Objects would keep feeling the same pull no matter how far they go.  A rocket could never fully escape Earth’s gravity because gravity would never weaken.
Inside the Earth: Instead of reducing as you go deeper, the pull would still be the same. That means at the very centre of Earth, you’d still feel a strong downward force, instead of floating weightless.

Q:Why moving charges produce both electric field and magnetic field but a current carrying conductor produces only magnetic field 
- Since a charge has a characteristic of producing an electric field of its own and since its moving as well so it produces magnetic field as in according to Biot Savart's Law. But a current carrying wire although contains charges produces electric field is cancelled by the opposite charges present in the wire. So electric field by a charge is neutralized by the opposite charge. Magnetic is produced as usual by electrons due to their locomotion

Q-Why does the current from the battery stop in a network where one capacitor is in series with the battery and two identical capacitors are in parallel, even though the parallel capacitors could still hold more charge?

-This is because for the series capacitor the potential difference across the plates of a series capacitor becomes equal to the voltage produced due to the batteries. Now since potential difference is zero current will not flow

Q: From where the energy for electrons to move in Brownian motion in a conductor come from?
-this energy is solely  due to thermal agitation at the surrounding temperature

Q: Why does the potential decrease across a resistor when current flows through it?
-When current flows through a resistor the electrons collide with atoms in the resistor’s lattice. These collisions convert electrical energy into heat energy. The voltage drop across the resistor represents the energy lost per unit charge as it passes.Now the electric potential decreases because the energy carried by the charges is partially spent to heat the resistor.
