Q.-What if Earth acceleration due to gravity is const above and below the earth surface?
-Above Earth: Objects would keep feeling the same pull no matter how far they go.  A rocket could never fully escape Earth’s gravity because gravity would never weaken.
Inside the Earth: Instead of reducing as you go deeper, the pull would still be the same. That means at the very centre of Earth, you’d still feel a strong downward force, instead of floating weightless.

Q:Why moving charges produce both electric field and magnetic field but a current carrying conductor produces only magnetic field 
- Since a charge has a characteristic of producing an electric field of its own and since its moving as well so it produces magnetic field as in according to Biot Savart's Law. But a current carrying wire although contains charges produces electric field is cancelled by the opposite charges present in the wire. So electric field by a charge is neutralized by the opposite charge. Magnetic is produced as usual by electrons due to their locomotion

Q-Why does the current from the battery stop in a network where one capacitor is in series with the battery and two identical capacitors are in parallel, even though the parallel capacitors could still hold more charge?

-This is because for the series capacitor the potential difference across the plates of a series capacitor becomes equal to the voltage produced due to the batteries. Now since potential difference is zero current will not flow
