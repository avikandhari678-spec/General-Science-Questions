Q.-What if Earth acceleration due to gravity is const above and below the earth surface?
-Above Earth: Objects would keep feeling the same pull no matter how far they go.  A rocket could never fully escape Earth’s gravity because gravity would never weaken.
Inside the Earth: Instead of reducing as you go deeper, the pull would still be the same. That means at the very centre of Earth, you’d still feel a strong downward force, instead of floating weightless.

Q:Why moving charges produce both electric field and magnetic field but a current carrying conductor produces only magnetic field 
- Since a charge has a characteristic of producing an electric field of its own and since its moving as well so it produces magnetic field as in according to Biot Savart's Law. But a current carrying wire although contains charges produces electric field is cancelled by the opposite charges present in the wire. So electric field by a charge is neutralized by the opposite charge. Magnetic is produced as usual by electrons due to their locomotion

Q-Why does the current from the battery stop in a network where one capacitor is in series with the battery and two identical capacitors are in parallel, even though the parallel capacitors could still hold more charge?

-This is because for the series capacitor the potential difference across the plates of a series capacitor becomes equal to the voltage produced due to the batteries. Now since potential difference is zero current will not flow

Q: From where the energy for electrons to move in Brownian motion in a conductor come from?
-this energy is solely  due to thermal agitation at the surrounding temperature

Q: Why does the potential decrease across a resistor when current flows through it?
-When current flows through a resistor the electrons collide with atoms in the resistor’s lattice. These collisions convert electrical energy into heat energy. The voltage drop across the resistor represents the energy lost per unit charge as it passes.Now the electric potential decreases because the energy carried by the charges is partially spent to heat the resistor.

Q-Why does a battery’s internal resistance increase as it discharges?
-Internal resistance rises because ion mobility decreases during discharge.Ions get deposited on electrodes, leaving fewer free to carry current.Fewer ions and interactions with water slow down movement. Hence Deposits hinder ion transfer.
Question: Although the candle has a higher temperature than the radiator, why does the radiator warm the room and not the candle?

Answer:
A candle’s flame has a higher temperature but gives off very little heat energy because its surface area is small. A radiator, though cooler in temperature, has a much larger surface area and continuously transfers heat to the surrounding air by radiation and convection. Hence, the radiator effectively warms the room, while the candle does not.


Q: Why is entropy defined?

A: Entropy is defined to measure the **degree of disorder or randomness** in a system. 
   It helps us **predict the direction of spontaneous processes** and understand why 
   nature prefers more probable arrangements. 🌿

Briefly: Entropy = measure of disorder = how spread out or random energy/matter is. 🔥❄️

Q:-idiomatic reversible entropy change your delta as total is equal to zero how can explain it qualitatively 
qualitatively does zero because it's all though we know that delta as total involves exchange of molecules but then you don't have exchange of exchange of molecules in adiabatic process because each and every molecule carries and energy and if a molecular transport then heat is also transfer because it contains energy because molecule contains energy 

When an electron jumps from n=2 → n=4, it absorbs energy.  
Now, if it “coincidentally” receives **exact energy** equal to the gap between n=4 → n=6,  
then YES — it can jump again to n=6.  

But if that exact energy isn’t available (like from a photon of that specific frequency),  
it **won’t re-jump** on its own.  

It also **won’t fall back** immediately unless it loses energy (by emitting a photon).  
So, it stays in n=4 temporarily — excited but stable till something interacts again.
