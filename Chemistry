Q. Why Charles' law require pressure to be low or negligible 
- Under low pressure molecules for apart consequently the intermolecular force of attraction between the molecules diminishes hence there is no change in any 
major characteristics of molecules. Accordingly we use high temperatures as well
Q. Why specific heat capacity depend on temperature 
-This is because at higher temperature you need energy to convert too electric modes or energy
Q- Sulphuric acid gets deprotonated in water why?
- Sulfuric acid does not hold on to hydrogen ion because hso4 - ion is stabilized easily by resonance of four oxygen atoms 
Q. Heat and work done are not state function why 
suppose for example we take one mole of water at 25 degree Celsius at one atmosphere and raise its temperature to 30 degree Celsius considering same pressure what is the heat in this case we cannot calculate heat because the process is not specified there are two ways in which this process can take place either you can you can just heated directly by putting it on a burner or a stir in such a way that the water reaches 30 degree Celsius. Here heat transfer is zero there is only energy transfer from the stirrer to water which heats up the liquid that is water. Now each of this processes have different work done as well, according to first law of thermodynamics
