Q. Why Charles' law require pressure to be low or negligible 
- Under low pressure molecules for apart consequently the intermolecular force of attraction between the molecules diminishes hence there is no change in any 
major characteristics of molecules. Accordingly we use high temperatures as well
Q. Why specific heat capacity depend on temperature 
-This is because at higher temperature you need energy to convert too electric modes or energy
Q- Sulphuric acid gets deprotonated in water why?
- Sulfuric acid does not hold on to hydrogen ion because hso4 - ion is stabilized easily by resonance of four oxygen atoms 
Q. Heat and work done are not state function why 
-Suppose for example we take one mole of water at 25 degree Celsius at one atmosphere and raise its temperature to 30 degree Celsius considering same pressure what is the heat in this case we cannot calculate heat because the process is not specified there are two ways in which this process can take place either you can you can just heated directly by putting it on a burner or a stir in such a way that the water reaches 30 degree Celsius. Here heat transfer is zero there is only energy transfer from the stirrer to water which heats up the liquid that is water. Now each of this processes have different work done as well, according to first law of thermodynamics
Q- If the number of moles is equal to mass of a substance by the molar mass of the substance then why isn't number of moles unitless property 
-This is because number of moles is defined as a physical quantity and according to the SI system every physical quantity has a unit so the unit for number of moles which is also called as amount of substance is declared as "mole"
Q-Why is Boyle's slow defined for zero density 
-The Boyle's law is defined at zero density because the pressure of gas goes to zero and temperature goes to infinity where in your gas molecules are infinity for a part and the force of attraction between molecules is zero hence the boyle law is obeyed t exactly. this is just an ideal case
Q-Why is it that there is restriction of rotation of bonds in alkenes
- 
Q-Why temperature is one of the factor affecting elimination reactions and not substitution reactions
-This is because elimination reactions have equilibrium mechanism in their reactions and equilibrium depends on temperature whereas substitution reactions do not have equilibrium mechanism in them hence there is no dependence on temperature 

Q: For a noble gas, do we consider it to have lower energy because it is quantitatively proven to have lower energy,
   or is this energy taken relative to some other element or state?

Ans:
Noble gases are considered to have *lower energy* both **quantitatively** and **relatively**.

1️⃣ Quantitatively:
   → When solved using quantum mechanics (Schrödinger equation), the total energy of a noble gas atom 
     (sum of orbital energies) is found to be minimal for that atomic number.
   → Its closed-shell configuration minimizes electron–electron repulsion and maximizes nuclear attraction stability.
   → Hence, noble gases truly exist in a state of absolute minimum energy.
   Example: Helium (1s²) shows total energy ≈ –79 eV, confirming its deep energy minimum.

2️⃣ Relatively:
   → In chemistry, when we say "noble gas configuration is low in energy," 
     we often mean *relative to neighboring atoms or ions*.
   → Atoms or ions that move toward a noble gas configuration (e.g., Na → Na⁺, Cl → Cl⁻)
     become more stable because their energy decreases relative to their unfilled-shell forms.

3️⃣ Experimentally:
   → Extremely high ionization enthalpies prove that noble gases resist losing electrons.
   → Near-zero electron affinities indicate that they do not gain electrons easily.
   → Both confirm that noble gases are already in a low-energy, stable state.

Conclusion:
   → Noble gas configurations represent an **energy minimum** both quantitatively (absolute) 
     and relatively (compared to nearby unstable configurations).
   → They act as “energy valleys” in the atomic world — every other element tends to move toward this stable state.

Q: Although NH₄⁺ is ionic, why does it have lower energy than NH₃ + H⁺?

Ans:
- Formation of NH₄⁺ involves creating strong N–H bonds.
- Bond formation releases energy, which can outweigh the energy cost of the positive charge.
- Total energy = bond energies + electrostatic energies; here, bond stabilization dominates.
- Hence, NH₄⁺ is energetically more stable than separate NH₃ + H⁺ despite being ionic.

Q: Why do we say a metal consists of a positive lattice?

Ans:
- In metals, atoms lose their valence electrons and become positive ions (cations).
- These cations arrange themselves in a regular lattice called the "positive lattice."
- The delocalized valence electrons move freely in the spaces between the ions, holding the lattice together via electrostatic attraction.
- Thus, the lattice is positive because the atoms themselves are cations, while the electrons in the gaps stabilize the structure.
